# WeatherMontpellier
- website URL: [cette adresse](https://h-bond826.github.io/WeatherMontpellier/).
- This is a personal project is to create: a GitHub web page displaying images representing the weather forecast for the 4 next days (in Montpellier) that automatically updates. 

## Description : 
- The data to be used for your project is to be obtained from [open_meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/meteofrance-api)
- I display the forecast together with the highest/lowest temperature for the day, wind average, and amount of precipitation.
- To make it refresh updated everyday, Github Action is used to trigger a workflow each 1 hours.
- I use Black to format our python code.

## About the table
You will find in the table:
- The date in the 1st line
- Today's weather icon in the 2nd line
- The maximum temperature in the 3rd line
- The minimum temperature in the 4th line
- The average wind in the 5th line
- The sum of the debits in the 6th line
I used the icon from [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org/search/?query=weather#google_vignette)
